# Kickoff meeting
## Date: 01.03.2023.

## Agenda:
 - Intro - getting to know each other
 - Focus of the audit and expected results
 - Organizational setup
 - Code walkthrough and technical questions

## Goals:
 - Focus of the audit: 
      - NMT specification: is it correct, complete, and understandable. Check for edge cases and potential bugs (by an honest or adversarial reader of the spec).
      - NMT implementation and the wrapper implementation: check for correctness, but also understandability and maintainability.
 - Desired outcome of the audit:
      - feedback on the spec and code
      - issue reports

 

## Organizational setup:

 - Sharing findings: in the [audit repo](https://github.com/informalsystems/audit-celestia)
 - Sync meetings: we agreed to meet weekly on Wednesdays per default (and cancel if there is nothing to discuss)
 - Communication channel: slack channel #informal-celestia-audit
